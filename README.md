# BIKE SALES ANALYSISðŸš²
This project analyzes sales data from the AdventureWorks sample database using SQL, Excel, and Tableau, and creates a dashboard for the bike sales data.

Overview
T In this project, we use SQL queries to extract data on bike sales from the AdventureWorks database, analyze it in Excel, and create a dashboard in Tableau.

Contents
The project contains the following files:

bike_sales.sql: contains the SQL queries used to extract the bike sales data from the AdventureWorks database.
bike_Sales.xlsx: contains the Excel spreadsheet used to analyze the bike sales data.
bike sales.twb: contains the Tableau workbook used to create the bike sales dashboard.
Getting Started
To run this project on your local machine, you'll need the following software:

SQL server and management studio
Microsoft Excel
Tableau Desktop
To set up the project, follow these steps:

Download the sample database from [bike database](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gvuexwfkfi1py29/SQL-Server-Sample-Database%20%282%29.zip?dl=0) and install it on your local SQL server.
Open bike_sales.sql in SQL Server Management Studio and execute the queries to extract the necessary bike sales data.
Open bike_Sales.xlsx in Microsoft Excel and import the bike sales data from the SQL queries.
Analyze the data in Excel and create any necessary charts or graphs.
Open bike sales.twb in Tableau and connect it to the data source in Excel.
Create the bike sales dashboard in Tableau.
Results
The results of the sales analysis are presented in bike_Sales.xlsx and the bike sales dashboard in bike sales.twb. The dashboard includes various charts and graphs that show trends and patterns in the bike sales data.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL, Excel, and Tableau can be used together to analyze and visualize bike sales data, and gain insights into business performance. The methods and techniques used in this project can be applied to other business domains and datasets.
